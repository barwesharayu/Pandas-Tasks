# Pandas-Tasks
Some real world data science tasks completed using python pandas library. 


The sales data of electronic devices is used from US country to complete this task.

I have used Python Pandas and Matplotlib liberaries to analyse, clean and plot the conclusions out of the data. 

Task 1: To merge all the CSV files into a single file for better analysis. 
Tas 2 : Cleaning the data: 
        1. Drop NaN fields from data
        2. Changing the data type of some of columns
        3. Removing some rows based on a condition 
        4. Adding some more columns to find the answers

Below are the questions that are answered so far in here: 

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most?
